## Write your own server based on the [guide](https://blog.appsignal.com/2016/11/23/ruby-magic-building-a-30-line-http-server-in-ruby.html)

Basic example in the `4. Backend` folder.

Requirements:

- 2 files, client and server
- Server sends messages, client receives
- Structure the solution in classes

## Additional task: [Build a chat based on the client-server](https://dev.to/sushant12/tcp-chat-app-with-ruby-i88)

For this, you'll need to create a thread that listens and a thread that sends messages on both the client and server. Display both streams in the console.
