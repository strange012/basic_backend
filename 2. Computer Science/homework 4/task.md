# Computer Science block homework (lesson 4)

## 1. Read the first chapter of the book ["Grokking Algorithms"](https://fliphtml5.com/mynym/cgao/%D0%93%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%BC_%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC%D1%8B_%28_PDFDrive_%29/)

## 2. Register on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and solve tasks

You can verify your solution on codewars. Also upload the completed code as a PR to GitHub. When solving problems, try to use fewer built-in "magical" functions that solve the problem in one action. For better mastery of the material, you can wrap solutions in classes, as we did in previous lessons.

* [Second task](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a1ebc2480171f29cf0000e5/train/ruby) (optional)
